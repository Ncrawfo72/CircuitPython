## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Makeing our serial montior print the words Hello World to test that Code pyhtponn is working properally.

```
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello world!")
    sleep(1)****
```

### Wiring
This is not nessacry or usefull

### Reflection
There was nothing difficult about this one it was rather straight forward and well explained in the instructions for the assignment.
